how to add and manipulate multiple background images , resizing and positioning.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background: url(./images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-position: top -170px left 0px, bottom -170px right 0px;
  background-size: 40%, 40%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
}
```
